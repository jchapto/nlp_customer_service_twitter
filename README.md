# uts_nlp_customer_service_twitter_group_2

In order to run both files, the dataset from Kaggle “Customer support on Twitter” (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter?datasetId=4133&sortBy=voteCount) has to be downloaded, and placed in the same folder as the Colab notebooks. Also, nlp_assessment3_part1.ipynb has to be runned first, because in this notebook the dataset is unzipped.
